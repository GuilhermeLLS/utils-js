# utils-js
A repo to find some easy, but always usefull functions in JS.

This was created with the intention to save you some time when you face a situation that you know the solution (or you can just go to stackoverflow), but you are so lazy to find/do it. The **utils-js** repo is a place for you to find exactly what you need, but way **faster** and the way you actually want it to behave.
