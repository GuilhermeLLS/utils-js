# utils-js
A repo to find some easy, but always usefull functions in TS.

This was created with the intention to save you some time when you face a situation that you know the solution (or you can just go to stackoverflow), but you are too lazy to find/do it. The **utils-ts** repo is a place for you to find exactly what you need, but way **faster** and the way you actually want it to behave.

Remember, what looks easy to you, might not be like that to others.
